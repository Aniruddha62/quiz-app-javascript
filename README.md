# Quiz App (JavaScript)

## Overview

This project is a timed multiple-choice Quiz Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The application presents a series of questions, tracks time elapsed, allows users to navigate between questions, and calculates the final score dynamically.

The goal of this project was to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and logical flow control using pure JavaScript.

## Features

- Start screen before quiz begins
- Multiple choice questions
- Next button navigation
- Real-time timer display
- Score calculation at the end
- Simple and responsive UI

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

## How It Works

1. User clicks the Start button.
2. Questions are displayed one by one.
3. User selects answers and navigates using the Next button.
4. Timer runs during the quiz.
5. Final score is calculated and displayed at the end.

## Learning Outcome

While building this project, I focused on:

- Handling user input using radio buttons
- Navigating between multiple question sets
- Implementing a timer using JavaScript
- Calculating and displaying quiz scores
- Managing DOM updates efficiently

## Future Improvements

- Add previous button navigation
- Randomize question order
- Store high scores using localStorage
